In 2006, the power was out on average for just 0.03 percent of the year in the United States. But right now, this system depends on getting most of its power from coal, nuclear and gas plants: big, dependable power plants that can be turned on and off when needed. As we add more electricity from renewable sources that can only make electricity when the sun shines or the wind blows, researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory have been modeling the power system to help utilities adjust their operations to make sure they can maintain those high levels of electricity reliability. The fact that utilities deliver us power 99.97 percent of the time is all the more impressive when you consider the fact that electricity is not easily stored. In effect, we have to make it right at the moment that we need it. This means that power companies must carefully balance the demand with the number of power plants they have up and running and how much they produce. This is called load balancing. The cardinal rule of load balancing is that you must always have more electricity generation capacity ready than you expect to need. Otherwise, a sudden surge in demand or a failure at a generator can lead to blackouts. Adding renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, makes the process trickier because these kinds of installations can’t supply power on command. Thus, as they add more renewable energy to the mix, utilities have to increase the amount of capacity they hold in reserve—often in the form of conventional power plants like coal or gas—in case the sky clouds over or the wind stops blowing at a crucial time. But because holding reserves is both financially and environmentally costly, utilities would like to minimize the amount they need to keep while still getting enough electricity to reliably meet consumers’ needs.  “How to best handle this is still very much an open question for utilities,” said Argonne energy systems engineer Audun Botterud. In the case of solar farms, utilities base their operational decisions on forecasts of solar power generation —from days ahead all the way down to an hour ahead or even less. But if the actual amount of sun deviates too much from the forecast—for example, a sudden cloud layer forms at the same time a lot of people turn on the air conditioning—a system that depends on solar becomes unstable, more costly and more vulnerable to blackouts. “Utilities have been forecasting for a long time,” Botterud said. “But their main experience is in forecasting the demand—that is, how much electricity consumers need. Adding solar power means they must also forecast supply as well.” In a recent study, Botterud and colleagues used real-world data from a power company to analyze patterns of forecasting errors and model possible scenarios to reduce the cost of adding more solar to the mix. “Even five minutes of clouds when we thought there’d be sun can equate to tens of thousands of dollars of extra costs from having to buy other forms of power from across the grid.” –Argonne meteorologist Edwin Campos Working with operations data from southwestern power utility Arizona Public Service Company, they modelled the utility grid with various scenarios ranging from nine percent solar all the way up to 17 percent solar. They created a framework to estimate the costs of forecast errors and solar power variability, both at the day-ahead and hour-ahead time horizon. The most costly incidents tended to happen in the hour-ahead range, when it is expensive to suddenly ramp up extra power plants. “Flexibility is a key aspect of integrating renewables into the grid,” Botterud said. “Traditionally, this flexibility comes from both the supply side—flexible thermal generators, for instance—but the demand side could contribute as well.” It’s also important for utilities to be able to trade power with each other, especially in times of low demand and very high solar energy generation, he said. This helps smooth out the peaks and valleys of electricity generation and consumption. The study presents a model to estimate the increase in operating costs as the utility adds more renewable power, and options for utilities to manage that cost. Botterud and others are planning to look more closely into consumer flexibility on the demand side and how much that could help utilities fit more renewables in the mix. For example, giving consumers tools to monitor their energy use and the price of electricity could allow them to reduce their power use at critical (and typically pricey) times. Moreover, the ability to cheaply store energy—which we don’t yet have—would be the ultimate source of flexibility. Read more about Argonne’s energy storage research. Another source of flexibility would be from advanced operational strategies. For instance, if utilities use probabilistic forecasts of solar generation, they can change the amount of reserves they hold based on the uncertainty in the weather forecasts. If there is a very low probability of clouds, the utility could allow itself to keep less capacity in reserve that afternoon. The aim is to create models for forecasters and utilities that use comprehensive data to reduce the costs of integrating solar power and devise ways to manage it. “This study was unique for the high resolution of data we used—down to the minute for load, solar and wind power yield,” Botterud said. “We hope this contributes to a body of research that can help utilities as they transition to more renewable power sources. The report, “Integrating Solar PV in Utility System Operations,” is available on Argonne’s website. Other Argonne authors were Zhi Zhou and Jing Wu.

Breaux • October 23, 2014 Tweet EmailPrint Argonne, Ill. – Forty students from Humphrey Middle School in Bolingbrook, Ill., converged on Argonne National Laboratory for a day of fun, mentoring and experimentation as part of the laboratory’s 10th annual Hispanic Educational Outreach Day on Oct. 14. The event, coordinated by the Hispanic Latino Club (HLC) of Argonne, invited Chicago area Hispanic students to the lab to give them hands-on experiences in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Ranging from 6th to 8th grade, the students conducted experiments, created presentations and explored career opportunities in STEM-related fields. “The STEM fields are experiencing a massive deficit in the number of Hispanics and blacks, mostly, because poorer communities lack exposure to these types of professionals,” said Michael Kaminski, HLC president and Argonne principal materials engineer. “By the time they reach 7th or 8th grade, these kids already have made decisions on what they feel they can do, and typically, STEM careers are not in that plan.” For the HLC, creating that spark of interest that allows young learners to envision themselves in science careers means presenting them with opportunities to do the work. This is why the organization focuses its outreach efforts on exposing a small group of students to the process of science and how scientists analyze data to find solutions. “We have big challenges to overcome, and our youth of today will be asked to explore and solve these challenges,” said Meridith Bruozas, Argonne's educational programs manager. “Initiatives like these are imperative to inspiring our best and brightest students towards STEM careers.” Students began their day in the lower gallery of the Advanced Photon Source where they learned about Argonne and the types of research the laboratory conducts. Smaller groups were then guided through several different types of experiments led by Argonne staff. Some students practiced extracting DNA and learned about how doctors safely use radiation to diagnose disease to provide therapies. Others explored the world of superconductivity and played detective using a spectrometer to analyze materials to solve a crime. Students also had the opportunity to create non-radioactive clay pellets similar to the ones used by researchers as fuel for nuclear reactors. In this session, Kaminski explained how nuclear energy is created and what other types of energy research Argonne conducts. During lunch, students were mentored by several Hispanic staff members, including Argonne researchers and support personnel from the Department of Energy and facilities management. In these one-on-one conversations, staff talked to students about what they do at the lab and how their education got them where they are. Students wrapped up their experience in the afternoon by giving presentations on what they learned during the day. With a little help from pre-formatted PowerPoint templates, students explained the process and their research findings and engaged each other about how to make the study of science a career choice.  “We are a small organization, but after 10 years we are starting to see the growth of our efforts,” said Kaminski. “One school at a time, we are either going out into the community or bringing these bright young minds to Argonne to give them the information and opportunity for a new vision of their future.” Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology.

Breaux • October 7, 2014 Tweet EmailPrint A hundred years ago, one out of every five people lived in urban areas. By 2050, that number will balloon to over four out of five. This rapid urbanization presents significant problems to the world. Even a modest annual population growth of three or five percent can mean thousands of new inhabitants, and each new resident will require energy, transportation, potable water, food and other infrastructure services that strain finite resources. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago are developing tools that merge urban design with scientific analysis to improve the decision-making process associated with large-scale urban developments. One such tool, called LakeSim, has been prototyped with an initial focus on consumer-driven energy and transportation demand, through a partnership with the Chicago-based architectural and engineering design firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Clean Energy Trust and developer McCaffery Interests.  LakeSim began with the need to answer practical questions about urban design and planning, requiring a better understanding about the long-term impact of design decisions on energy and transportation demand for a 600-acre development project on Chicago’s South Side—the Chicago Lakeside Development project. For decades, urban planners and developers have relied upon intuition to guide their decision-making process. But this sixth sense is significantly less effective at larger-scale developments where hundreds of buildings and dozens of interconnected services will reside over the course of decades. “For a single building, developers have to make decisions based on varying reports from the energy developers, the economic analysts, transportation planners, and others,” said Charlie Catlett, LakeSim CO-principal investigator, Argonne Mathematics and Computer Science division computational scientist and director of the Urban Center for Computation and Data (UCCD). “The challenge is what to do that with hundreds of buildings going in over a 20-year timeframe.” To address the uncertainty of large-scale planning with so many complex variables, LakeSim creators have prototyped a new platform that seeks to help developers plan at massive scales while anticipating the ability to build in future scenarios such as climate change, improved efficiency in buildings and transportation systems and increased renewable energy and/or micro-grid applications. Large-scale planning is both an art and a science. Planners want a pleasing cityscape, but buildings must also provide for specific residency or occupational purposes. LakeSim employs the specifications of dozens of building design types supplied by sources ranging from Department of Energy data libraries to Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Each building type features unique structural parameters, allowing designers to pick and choose different types and place these in a virtual map. With an emphasis on integrating scientific and engineering models into platforms used by industry, the project selected CityEngine, an interactive 3-D design system from Redlands, CA-based Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), as the central component of LakeSim. ESRI supplies geographical information system software that allows organizations and industries to question, analyze and interpret data that reveal relationships and trends with 3-dimensional computer models. CityEngine serves as the “dashboard” through which the urban designer interacts with the city designs. Computational models can be invoked to analyze changes with respect to energy demand over time, and the developers are looking to integrate other models.  The future goal of this map is to create an interconnected virtual city where changes to plans can be analyzed in real time instead of weeks.  Planners can refine and monitor development progress as individual buildings aggregate into zones, and zones etch out residential and commercial borders. With this in mind, one of the most important sectors where LakeSim hopes to assist in decision-making is energy. The power streaming into our homes and businesses is a balanced coordination between energy suppliers and energy producers. To provide planners with better energy demand forecasts throughout the life of the development, LakeSim employs the Energy Performance Standard Calculation Toolkit (EECalc) developed by Argonne and the Georgia Institute of Technology. EECalc generates monthly estimates of a building’s, or block’s, thermal energy demand and consumption for heating and cooling. As each structure has unique architectural features, they also have unique demands on energy. Based on a number of end-user factors, including ventilation, lighting and heating and cooling, EECalc can assess the energy efficiency of an architectural design.  LakeSim co-principal investigator Leah Guzowski, an Argonne energy policy scientist and University of Chicago fellow, led the team responsible for developing EECalc. Her team uses analytics that are faster, less expensive and less data-intensive compared to conventional methods, and also addresses uncertainty issues. “We have been working on energy assessment analytics for a number of years,” said Guzowski, “and we have developed and continue to refine key data points that are needed to forecast energy use under different conditions. "It will be especially interesting to turn our attention to determining economically viable supply-side options that minimize future global impact, and to do so in a way that is not constrained by conventional infrastructure bounds," she said. As LakeSim calculates the interconnectedness between each part of the plan, users can make structural changes and see in real time how this affects energy demand and supply for the block, or for the entire region.   “LakeSim is a very nice bridge between real-estate developers and architects,” said Ed Woodbury, president of Chicago-based property development McCaffery Interests. ”It helps us identify and solve problems encountered by designers so we can come up with real-world solutions.” Currently, data assimilation and modeling is typically performed using desktop machines. But as you can imagine, providing real-time calculations affecting hundreds of thousands of parameters that exist in an urban environment takes a lot of computing power. Perhaps in the future, a tool such as LakeSim could require resources located at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, which houses Mira, currently the fifth fastest supercomputer in the world.   With this computing power, urban planners could better anticipate extreme weather or power outage events and build safeguards into the structures and energy systems they design. Imagine a power outage on Fifth Avenue during the daytime in July of 2045. By running a multitude of scenarios, and determining how each structure and block responds to certain events, planners could optimize the balance of energy with more solar or wind power, or increase energy storage capacity to a particular section of a city development, minimizing the effects of major weather or energy events. This would give energy producers and builders a more scientifically rigorous range of potential energy demands in the near and far future in minutes, allowing them to better anticipate the need for renewable and traditional forms of energy before they lift a shovel. “These tools are really based on looking at lots and lots of different scenarios to provide any developer in the world with science-based insight about the long term consequences of design decisions,” said Woodbury. “Without such tools, rapid urbanization will be guided by 20th century ‘educated guess’ urban design principles. That process may have worked in the past, but it’s not going to produce the cities that we need for the 21th century and beyond.” Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology.
