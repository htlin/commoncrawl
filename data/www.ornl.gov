The tools of the CSMB will help understand how these macromolecular systems are formed and how they interact with other systems in living cells. The focus of the CSMB is to bridge the information gap between cellular function and the molecular mechanisms that drive it. The suite of tools being developed by the CSMB includes: Bio-SANS, a Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) facility for biological samples, has been completed at the ORNL High-Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). The CSMB is also closely aligned with researchers at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). Isotope Labeling Laboratories for cloning, gene expression, purification and characterization of labeled biological macromolecules are planned; our Bio-Deuteration Lab is currently operational and accepting proposals. Computational Techniques have been developed for the study of macromolecular complexes by SANS. Combined with selective Deuterium-labeling, it is now possible to develop detailed structural models that will enable the understanding of function. Another computation technique developed for the study of calculates solution small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering intensity profiles by ORNL-SAS. This makes it possible to develop from a wide variety of structures, including atomicresolution models of proteins and protein complexes, low-resolution models defined in any manner, or combinations of both. Neutron diffraction, spectroscopy and scattering are excellent tools for studying biological systems because neutrons interact differently with hydrogen and its isotope deuterium. As a result, it is possible to: pinpoint individual hydrogen positions in proteins probe the structure and dynamics of proteins, nucleic acids and membranes characterize higher order complexes These studies use neutrons to address questions that have not - or cannot - be answered by other techniques. SANS can be used to study biological systems under near physiological conditions, providing insight into interactions within complexes and conformational changes in response to stimuli. Through the use of specific deuterium labeling SANS makes it possible to highlight and map components within larger complexes (e.g. viruses, ribosome). The SANS instruments at ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor and Spallation Neutron Source will open new opportunities for studying conformational changes and molecular processes on biologically relevant timescales. The CSMB welcomes interest from researchers from a wide variety of scientific disciplines including Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Computational Sciences.

ORNL provides two of the most powerful neutron science facilities in the world—the High Flux Isotope Reactor and the Spallation Neutron Source. The HFIR produces one of the brightest steady-state neutron streams on Earth, and the SNS produces the world’s most intense pulsed neutron beams. Through materials research, scientists are discovering remarkable ways to address our energy needs, such as superconducting power cables that eliminate power-transmission losses and prevent outages, liquid transportation fuels produced from biomass, and magnetic refrigerators that use half the energy of conventional appliances. To bring such technologies into common use, researchers need to be able to view materials from the atom-to-atom scale to a full systems view. Developing these advanced materials requires manipulating the properties of alloys at the atomic level, and neutron scattering is a key tool in this quest. Neutrons show where atoms are and what they are doing at scales smaller than the best electron microscopes. They let researchers see in real time how the atomic lineup in a material shifts with changes in temperature, pressure, and magnetic or electronic fields. They trace the electron motions that give materials properties such as magnetism or the ability to conduct electricity—all essential information in the quest for energy savings. Satisfying the world’s growing hunger for energy requires finding ways to use power more frugally and developing methods for sustainably producing additional energy. Neutron scattering aids the creation of new materials engineered for both purposes. Learn more about using HFIR in your research.

BTRIC’s mission is to identify, develop, and deploy energy-efficient building system technologies by forming partnerships between DOE and private industry for technology development and analysis, well-characterized laboratory and field experiments, and market outreach. The BTRIC user facility was established by DOE’s Office of Building Technology State and Community Programs as a designated National User Facility. The facilities are available to manufacturers, universities, and other organizations for proprietary and nonproprietary research and development. Access to these unique facilities and capabilities is obtained through user agreements, Work for Others (WFO) arrangements, and cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs).

There’s the design of aircraft, for instance, or the fundamental elements of industrial design. The virtual environment provides a much quicker way for us to improve our understanding of older problems and break ground in our understanding of new phenomena with ramifications for how we live our lives. Machines like Titan and activities like the Titan project will be the vehicles that allow us to explore these fundamental things in computational science. They will provide a framework for better product design, new and innovative technologies, and new materials. And they will enable new insights into how very complex, nonlinear systems work; that, again, has implications for a lot of the technologies that we take for granted. OLCF is a user facility that recognizes that its products are scientific discovery and technical innovation, and we will achieve this vision working with strong partners. These partnerships will be developed through our calls for proposals and our outreach efforts to the scientific, technology, and industrial communities. To broaden the scope of leadership computing, we need to engage through our networks, through our relationships, and encourage users from new communities that can take good advantage of these resources to move us forward in scientific discovery, industrial competitiveness, and sustainability. Partnerships and alliances are a big part of what is important about our research. In terms of challenges, clearly we’re at a cusp in technology moving to hybrid architectures. This implies a lot of hard work by a lot of people. But it also is a game changer.  OLCF website User Facilities BTRICBuilding Technologies Research Integration Center CNMSCenter for Nanophase Materials Sciences CSMBCenter for Structural Molecular Biology CFTFCarbon Fiber Technology Facility HFIRHigh Flux Isotope Reactor MDFManufacturing Demonstration Facility NTRCNational Transportation Research Center OLCFOak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility SNSSpallation Neutron Source Science & Discovery Advanced Materials Clean Energy National Security Neutron Sciences Nuclear Sciences Supercomputing & Computation More Science US ITER Hubs, Centers, and Institutes About Us Fact Sheet Brochure Leadership Team Diversity Organization History Lab-Directed R&D Environmental Policy Video Overviews For The Public News Community Outreach R&D Magazine Educational Programs Corporate Giving Speakers Bureau History Careers Visit ORNL Contact Us For Researchers User Facilities Research Library Events & Conferences Science & Discovery Organization Lab-directed R&D Careers Visit ORNL Contact Us For Academia Educational Programs Science & Discovery Research Library User Facilities Partnerships Careers News Events & Conferences Visit ORNL Contact Us For Industry Work with ORNL Partnerships Sponsored Research Economic Development Procurement Small Business Programs Careers Visit ORNL Contact Us ASK ORNL We're always happy to get feedback from our users.

ORNL’s user facilities offer a diverse set of tools for experiments across a range of fields, including biology, materials and energy sciences, physics, engineering, and chemistry. ORNL’s user facilities include world-leading facilities for neutron scattering, high performance computing, material and nanoscale research, and additive manufacturing. Access to ORNL user facilities is through the review and approval of user proposals, and depends on the scientific merit, suitability of the user facilities, and the appropriateness of the work to DOE objectives. DOE requires ORNL to execute user agreements, typically with a researchers’ institution, prior to granting access to a user facility.
