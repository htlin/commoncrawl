Home » Mpc » Rare Earth Metals and Alloys Rare Earth Metals and Alloys Terbium (Tb) and Cerium (Ce) phosphors in your computer screen allow you to see GREEN. Europium (Eu) is the source of the RED light and BLUE emitted by our display. The Ames Laboratory has been actively involved in the preparation of very pure rare earth metals since the early 1940's when Dr. Frank H. Spedding and his group of pioneers developed the ion-exchange process, a technique that separates the "fraternal fifteen" plus yttrium and scandium. As a result of this and subsequent work, high-purity oxides are available from which high-purity rare earth metals can be prepared. In most cases, the rare earth oxides are first converted to their respective fluorides and are then reduced metallothermicaly on a kilogram scale, using pure calcium metal specially sublimed for this purpose, this is call the Ames Process. The resulting metals are very pure. Nonetheless, many are further refined at the MPC by one of the following processes: vacuum casting sublimation distillation zone refining electro-transport processing Quantities of high-purity rare earth metals and alloys in single and polycrystalline forms are available to scientists outside of Ames Laboratory. Complete chemical analyses, obtained by  mass spectrometry, inert gas fusion and combustion analysis, accompany the materials. Special preparations of high-purity alloys and compounds are also available in small quantities.

Materials Preparation Center - The Materials Preparation Center (MPC) is a U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences & Engineering speciallized research center located at the Ames Laboratory. MPC is recognized throughout the worldwide research community for its unique capabilities in the preparation, purification, single crystal growth, and characterization of rare earth metals, alkaline-earth metals, and refractory metal materials. MPC operations are primarily funded by the Materials Discovery, Design, & Synthesis team's Synthesi s &  Processing Science core research activity. Midwest Forensics Resource Center - Midwestern crime laboratory directors met and identified four mission areas in which Iowa State University and Ames Laboratory could work to support the regional crime laboratories: casework assistance, training, education, and research. Together with Ames Laboratory and Iowa State University, the Midwestern crime laboratory directors proposed to establish the Midwest Forensics Resource Center to address the crime laboratory needs in these areas. Iowa State University responded by creating the MFRC, within the Institute for Physical Research and Technology, in order to carry out this program of work.
